 	   	        The ancient city of Apollonia is situated in southwestern Albania, about 13 miles from the city of Fier. The fascinating landscape of the archeological park, which has been preserved in an exceptionally intact condition, comprises a successful combination between the beauty of monuments and nature, attractive through its long history, in an atmosphere of relaxation and meditation. Its foundation took place immediately after the foundation of Epidamnus – Dyrrachium and quickly became one of the most eminent cities of the Adriatic basin, which was mentioned more frequently from the other 30 (thirty) cities bearing the same name during Antiquity."

		<h4>Butrint</h4>
		<p>
			"Butrint National Park is located on a small peninsula jetting off the mainland in southern Albania based around the ancient city of Butrint.  The national park encompasses an area of 36.37 square miles (94.2 sq km).
			The small peninsula based national park is comprised of marshes, reed beds, coastal waters, rocky shorelines, sandy beaches, and Mediterranean forests.  In addition to these facets of nature, the national park features ancient Roman ruins and a small Amphitheatre as part of the ruins. It is the ecological lagoon environment where the archaeological gem sits that makes this national park such a treasure."

		<h4>Kruja Castle</h4>
		<p>
			"WHEN THE POWERFUL OTTOMAN EMPIRE was slowly taking over several parts of Europe during the 15th century, one small medieval castle in Albania remained out of its reach.

Krujë castle was built in the 5th or 6th century, perched above the city of the same name. At the time of the Ottoman threat, it was the headquarters of Gjergj Kastrioti, the “Dragon of Albania,” an Albanian nobleman and military commander. Kastrioti was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman court early in his life, and after leaving service, led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in Albania."
